*un_chapeau* is a server for the Mastodon protocol, implemented in Django.

It's currently some way from being useable.

For what's left to do, please see [the TODO list](TODO.md).

See also the [Mastodon API reference](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-the-API/API.md#account).

In case anyone's wondering, the default avatar was taken from [the cover](http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/jugend1914_2/0109/image) of an issue of the German art noveau magazine *Jugend*, painted in 1914 by Paul Rieth.
